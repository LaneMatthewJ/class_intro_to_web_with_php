**Communication Means**

*Canvas will be the primary means for communication of coursework and announcements to students.  To contact me, please contact me via Email or Text Messaging.  Students are welcome to call my cell phone but I cannot always pick up the phone.  If a student leaves a voicemail I will call back when I am available.  I will reply via email or text within 24 hours.*

**Coursework**

*There will be four project assignments assigned throughout the semester.  These projects will be individually submitted and the work will need to be unique among all submissions.  All programs must run in a web browser (e.g. Chrome/Firefox).  Individual project submissions that are identical to another individual’s project submission will result in zero points for that project for all involved.*

**Coursework Submission**

*All coursework will be submitted through Canvas.  Multiple submissions are allowed, I will only grade the latest submission.  Submissions through Canvas will be allowed up until one week after the posted due date and time for each assignment.  Submissions by the posted due date and time will have the ability to earn full credit.  Submissions by one week after the posted due date and time will be penalized by a full letter grade (normally deducting 10 points out of 100).  Submissions after one week after the posted due date and time will not be accepted and will receive zero points.*

**Tests**

*There will be two tests: a midterm and a final.  All tests are open book and open notes.  Cheating on tests will result in zero points for that test for all involved.*
