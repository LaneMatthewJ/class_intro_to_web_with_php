# Project 1: 

For this project, your goal is to: 

1. Create a working website, using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Bootstrap**. 

2. Your site must include: 

   1. A working navbar with links. 
      1. Links must be to other sections of the website or secondary pages (i.e. other pages you have built). 
   2. At least one container with a working Bootstrap Grid system integration. 
      1. Grid system must be integrated in such a way that there are **three** different variations for size **small (or extra small)**, **medium**, and **large (or extra large)**.  
   3. Some biographical data (it doesn't really matter if it's factual or not). These section needs to make use of classes that **indent** and **justify** the text in some way. : 
      1. An "about me" section. 
      2. An "interests" section
   4. Your site must contain either a **table** or **list** of some kind that must be *stylized* in some way. 

   

   

   Note:

   - **All code must contain proper usage of classes and ids.**
   - **If you take code from a site (such as w3Schools), be sure to properly cite it.**
