# Project II

Take your website from project 1, add to it:

1. Prompt the user, asking the user for their username. 
   1. Write a function to validate whether or not the user input a name. If the user left it blank, re-prompt the user to enter their name. 
   2. The username must then be rendered on the page as a welcome.
2. 5 Buttons that change the coloration / styling of the page. You must use the below methods to retrieve the elements, and then update their stylings ( a good method of changing styling would be something of changing column sizes / colors / etc ). Each styling set must be noticeably different: 
   1. querySelector
   2. querySelectorAll
   3. getElementByID
   4. getElementsByClassName
   5. getElementsByTagName
